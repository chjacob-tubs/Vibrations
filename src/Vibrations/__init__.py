Vibrations
==========

Vibrations is a Python code for vibrational calculations with
user-defined vibrational modes. For an overview of the capabilities
of the code, see the following articles U{ChemPhysChem 15 (2014) 3365 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.201402251>},
U{J. Chem. Phys. 144 (2016) 164111 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4947213>}, and
U{J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7 (2016) 3084 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b01451>}.

B{Usage}

See C{examples} directory for some examples of typical runs.

Vibrations can be run using Python's interpreter, or interactively with
some of the interactive Python consoles.

B{Requirements}

Vibrations is an independent code that for running needs only Python standard packages, extended with NumPy and SciPy.
However for typical usage, where normal modes from previous calculations are read in, the potential energy surfaces are
calculated with QM programs, another packages are needed
 - U{LocVib package<http://www.christophjacob.eu/>} for reading in normal modes, localizing them, etc.
 - U{PyADF suite<http://pyadf.org>} as an interface to QM codes, for calculating potential energy and property surfaces

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome.
