In step B, you have to run single point calculations for all the structures
in the directory 'grid' (filenames grid_[vX_A_B].xyz).

The results should be written to the directory 'energies' into one file for
each single point, named [vX_A_B].dat (same as xyz files, but without 'grid'
in the beginning and with extension '.dat').

Each of these files contains
Total energy, dipole moment x, y, z (separated by spaces)
